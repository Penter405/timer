WCA about time count
```
9f) The results of a round are measured as follows:
9f1) All timed results under 10 minutes, except for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, are measured and truncated to hundredths of a second. All timed averages and means under 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second.
9f1+) EXAMPLE If the timer displays 12.678 for an attempt, the original recorded time is 12.67 (drop any digit after a hundredth of a second). A judge may write the full-precision time on the score sheet (and keep the precision in the calculation of penalties), as long as the score taker truncates it for the official results.
9f2) All timed results over 10 minutes, as well as all times for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind results, are measured and truncated to seconds. All timed averages and means over 10 minutes are measured and rounded to the nearest second (e.g. X.49 becomes X, X.50 becomes X+1).
9f2+) ADDITION For 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, the judge should record the number of puzzles solved, the number of puzzles attempted, and the final time. For example, if the competitor solves 3 cubes out of 5 attempted cubes in 40 minutes and 30 seconds, the judge should write down 3/5 40:30.
